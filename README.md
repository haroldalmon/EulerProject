# EulerProject
A place where I can save my solutions to the ProjectEuler problems.
I am making an effort to use meaning variable names and few comments
so that you can easily understand the code.

This sight is not meant for getting solutions to problems that you
have not solved.  That is pointless.  Keep in mind that these are
my solutions and the may not be the most efficient or best solution
but they produce the correct answers.

Checkout my solution to problem 81.  There is probably a better
dynamic programming solution but what I have works and the solution
is very fast.
