# ProjectEuler
This is a place where I can save my solutions to the ProjectEuler problems.
Keep in mind that these are
my solutions and the may not be the most efficient or best solution
but they produce the correct answers.

This site is __not__ meant for getting solutions to problems that you
have not solved.  __That is pointless__.  This site exists so I can 
try languages and tools like Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, JUnit, and Git with
a well known problem set. 

You can find the problems at [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
