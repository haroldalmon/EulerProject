# ProjectEuler
This is a place where I can save my solutions to the ProjectEuler problems.
I am making an effort to use meaning variable and function names 
so that you can easily understand the code. Keep in mind that these are
my solutions and the may not be the most efficient or best solution
but they produce the correct answers.

This site is __not__ meant for getting solutions to problems that you
have not solved.  __That is pointless__.  This site exists so I can 
try languages and tools like Ruby, JavaScript, JUnit, and git with
a problem set that is very challenging. 

You may find one or more solutions for a problem because I sometimes
try an array or hashmap solution to the same problem.  Most solutions
are written in Java although I just started providing solutions in Ruby.

The Java code has extensive refactoring based on the principles 
found in the books __Code Complete__ and __Clean Code__.  I also
improved the initial JUnit tests with more advanced functionality and
developed test suites for the entire problem set.
