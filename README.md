# ProjectEuler
This is a place where I can save my solutions to the ProjectEuler problems.
I am making an effort to use meaning variable names and few comments
so that you can easily understand the code.

This site is __not__ meant for getting solutions to problems that you
have not solved.  __That is pointless__.  Keep in mind that these are
my solutions and the may not be the most efficient or best solution
but they produce the correct answers.

You may find one or more solutions for a problem because I sometimes
try an array or hashmap solution to the same problem.

After reading an article called __"Why Comments Are Stupid, a Real Example"__
by John Somnez, I decided to start a re-factoring project that is eating 
up all my spare time.

At this point, I have re-factored about 60% of the code on this site.
Once that is done, I can get back to working on ProjectEuler solutions again.
