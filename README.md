# ProjectEuler
This is a place where I can save my solutions to the ProjectEuler problems.
I am making an effort to use meaning variable names and few comments
so that you can easily understand the code.

This site is __not__ meant for getting solutions to problems that you
have not solved.  __That is pointless__.  Keep in mind that these are
my solutions and the may not be the most efficient or best solution
but they produce the correct answers.

You may find one or more solutions for a problem because I sometimes
try an array or hashmap solution to the same problem.  Most solutions
are written in Java although I just started providing solutions ih Ruby.

**UPDATE: Just add a couple of solutions written in Ruby.**
